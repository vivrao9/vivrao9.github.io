      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="copy">In 2014, the healthcare world was introduced to a new idea: the Quadruple Aim framework.</p>
      <p class="copy">The framework suggested that health systems (i.e., hospital chains) focus on four goals:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reducing costs</li>
          <li>Improving population health</li>
          <li>Patient experience, and</li>
          <li>Team well-being</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="copy">In 2024, Providence Health decided to adopt this at a system-level. There was a sense of urgency because the COVID-19 pandemic had challenged the organization’s finances. To improve the health system’s...health, leaders needed a common framework for performance management.</p>

      <h2>Business problem</h2>
      <p class="copy">Executives had the following pain points:</p>
      <img src="img/biz-problem-pyramid.svg" alt="Sn image of a pyramid with three levels. The foundation of the pyramid reads 'Strategy: There was no alignment on which metrics were most important.' The middle level reads 'Back-end: There were different definitions and calculations for each metric, leading to a lack of trust.' The top-most level reads 'Front-end: Different teams updated different reports every month which had to be manually updated, leading to a lengthy update process.'" style="margin-bottom: 2vh; width: 100%;" />
      <p class="copy">System-level executives wanted one balanced scorecard to present these metrics and whether or not they were meeting monthly targets. This report would be used at Monthly Operating Reviews (MORs) to see what areas to focus on in the following month.</p>

      <h2>User research</h2>
      <p class="copy">A team of user researchers performed a competitive analysis for three legacy dashboards that executives used at the time. These three reports were to be sunset and consolidated into one new report called <b>System Quad Aim</b>.</p>
      <p class="copy">I created and disseminated a baseline survey to collect feedback on the legacy dashboards. Through this, we quantified users’ perceptions on the legacy dashboards around metric refresh rates, navigability, ease-of-use, and more. After analyzing responses, we learned most users felt it was difficult to understand what metrics they were looking at.</p>

      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p class="copy">This project challenged my assumptions about dashboard creation. Executives at Providence were interested in seeing all 31 metrics at the same time. I had to design a screen that fit all those metrics in a way that didn’t overwhelm users and also surfaced the most important pieces of information.</p>
      <p class="copy">We went through multiple rounds of iteration and incorporated user feedback on each update.</p>

    <h2>Concept testing</h2>
      <p class="copy">After creating some rough mockups, we led a roadshow to get feedback from end users. I conducted seven one-on-one user interviews and demoed Figma mockups.</p>
      <p>Our biggest takeaways were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Executives were interested in improving performance. They wanted their eyes to move to those metrics that were not meeting targets.</li>
        <li>Executives wanted to quickly compare all facilities within their purview to see which ones were under-performing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="copy">We took this feedback back to the drawing board and iterated on our designs. We introduced a Comparisons page, and added more visual cues to highlight when metrics didn’t meet targets.</p>

      <h2>Usability testing</h2>
      <p class="copy">I piloted usability testing for the first time at Providence. I led 12 usability tests with end users. These were 30-minute one-one-one sessions where users thought out loud while completing pre-defined exercises.</p>
      <p class="copy">From our tests, we learned that filtering on the Summary page was tricky. Many users didn’t know how to drill down from the system-level to the unit-level.</p>
      <p class="copy">Besides this, most users said the scorecard was “intuitive.” I summarized the findings and presented them at a formal read-out.</p>

      <h2>Launch and impact</h2>
      <p class="copy">In the months after this product launched, it created a wave throughout the organization. Board meetings and MORs across the organization required attendees to present using the scorecard.</p>
      <p class="copy">In the five months since the scorecard launched, <b>it was viewed over 13,000 times by 1,000 people</b> across the organization. Unlike most dashboards which go through dashboard rot, this dashboard was viewed on a consistent cadence (see below).</p>
      <p class="copy">The scorecard became a part of the organization’s vernacular: many executives approached the design team on other engagements asking us to build “Quad Aim but for [another domain]” and wanted it to “match the look-and-feel of the Quad Aim scorecard.”</p>
      <!-- <img src='img/Data pipeline.png' alt="A diagram of 14 data files moving through five Python scripts to become three consolidated tables stored on AWS Athena, before being read into Tableau." class="storyImg"> -->

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p class="copy">For the first time in the analytics department, we conducted a follow-up survey to assess how effective SQA was as an executive scorecard. The survey had nearly identical questions to the baseline survey to allow for easy comparison.</p>
      <p class="copy">We learned that, in almost all areas, the SQA was a net positive from legacy dashboards, i.e., it was an improvement. The only places it lagged behind were on “understandable at-a-glance” and “overall satisfaction.” After digging through qualitative feedback, we learned that most users were confused by the tool’s refresh schedule. Metrics updated on different cadences and that didn’t interact well with users’ MOR schedules.</p>
      <p class="copy">This will be addressed in following iterations of the scorecard.</p>
